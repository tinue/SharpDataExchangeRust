# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project may contain
breaking changes in every release, major or minor, until version 1.0.0 is reached
(the C ABI and the Rust API included); from 1.0.0 on it follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`bin/release` reads the section for the version being released and uses it as the
GitHub release notes, so keep entries user-facing.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- `lib/native-libs-windows.txt` (added in 0.1.1) was corrupted by a stray ANSI
  color-reset escape (`CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always` in CI coloring a note captured
  from a redirected, non-tty stderr) and its doc comment wrongly described the
  content as GCC `-lname` syntax; it's actually MSVC linker tokens (bare
  `name.lib` filenames and the occasional `/defaultlib:x` flag). Packaging now
  captures it with `CARGO_TERM_COLOR=never` and strips escapes defensively.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Windows release archives now include `lib/native-libs-windows.txt`: the Windows
  system import libs (`ws2_32`, `userenv`, `bcrypt`, ...) a non-cargo consumer
  linking the raw `sharpdx.lib` needs to supply itself, captured straight from
  `rustc --print=native-static-libs` for that build rather than left for every
  downstream consumer to guess.
- Platform-aware line endings for de-tokenized listings. The output now uses the
  host convention by default — `CRLF` on Windows, `LF` on macOS / Linux — and the
  terminator is overridable: `--eol auto|lf|crlf|cr` on the CLI,
  `sharpdx::convert_with(.., LineEnding)` in the crate, and a new
  `SdeLineEnding line_ending` argument on `sde_detokenize` / `sde_convert` in the
  C ABI.
- macOS releases are signed with a Developer ID and notarized (hardened runtime),
  so they run without a Gatekeeper warning. The `sde` / `libsharpdx.dylib` in the
  `.tar.gz` are notarized; a new **`SharpDataExchange-<version>.pkg`** installer is
  published alongside it — signed, notarized, and stapled — with a choice between
  an all-users install (`/usr/local/bin`) and a per-user one (`~/.local/bin`,
  added to `~/.zshrc`).

### Changed

- Tokenizing now accepts `CR` and `CRLF` line endings in the input listing on
  every platform (previously a real Windows `.bas` file with `CRLF` endings could
  leave a stray `0x0D` in the payload).
- **C ABI break:** `sde_detokenize` and `sde_convert` take an extra
  `SdeLineEnding line_ending` parameter (pass `SDE_LINE_ENDING_PLATFORM` for the
  previous-style host default). `sde_tokenize` is unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- ROM-style linear scanner (`src/scanner.rs`) that tokenizes Sharp PC-1500 /
  PC-1600 BASIC in one left-to-right pass with a 3-state (normal / string /
  verbatim) model, instead of a grammar.
- `sde convert` CLI: content-detected direction, `-d/--device`
  `pc1500|pc1500a|pc1600|pc1600emul`, file or stdin/stdout I/O, output-path
  derivation.
- `libsharpdx` C ABI (`sde_convert`, `sde_tokenize`, `sde_detokenize`,
  `sde_detect`, `sde_version`, `sde_last_error`, `sde_buf_free`) with a
  panic-free boundary and caller-freed buffers. Committed C header and Swift
  module map generated from `src/ffi.rs`.
- `sharpdx` Rust crate exposing the pure `convert` core.
- Byte-parity test suite against the Java `SharpDataExchange` `convert` fixtures,
  plus round-trip and C-ABI tests.
- Release archives for macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux x86-64 / arm64, and Windows
  x64 / arm64, each bundling the CLI, the static and shared libraries, and the
  `include/` directory.

### Known limitations

- `convert` only — no `get` / `put` / `terminal`, serial I/O, Variables /
  Reserve-Area conversion, or cassette headers.
- PC-1600-only token values are limited to what `Pc1600Keywords.java` lists;
  unknown `>= 0xE0` byte pairs pass through opaquely.
- The CE-158 header filename field is upper-cased (the historical fixture stored
  it lower-case); `testsuite.md` marks those bytes "don't care". Payloads match
  the Java output exactly.
